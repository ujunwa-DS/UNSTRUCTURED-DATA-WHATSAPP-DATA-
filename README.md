# UNSTRUCTURED-DATA-WHATSAPP-DATA-
Having worked a lot with structured data, I needed work that will stretch my python knowledge. Unstructured data from WhatsApp is very dirty data that requires a lot of python knowledge to clean.


PROBLEM STATEMENT
In a company with many workers who uses WhatsApp as a means of communication, how can one ascertain active participants of the company, words frequently used, active time of participants, period of existence and number of chats per month. Having this vital information will inform the leaders of the activeness of the group. 


METHODOLOGY
The file was first exported from WhatsApp on the phone. Click on the three dots on the right-hand side>more>export.  The file was saved as text and transferred to a laptop through Bluetooth. 
Using Jupyter notebook (.pynb), all necessary libraries like Regex(regular expression for identifying pattern and extraction), NumPy (for numbers), pandas( for structuring the data better for analysis), DateTime (for changing the date into date_time) and openpyxl (excel converter)  were imported.
The data was processed with these libraries and structured.
The excel file obtained was imported into Power BI for dashboard visualization to obtain good insight.
